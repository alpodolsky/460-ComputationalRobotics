Problem 1 [50 points]. Multilateration in 3D. You are to implement the function named multilaterate(distances) in the provided template python code in the ﬁle multilaterate.py. The function multilaterate(distances) takes a list of lists as its input. The list should have four landmark locations with associated (x,y,z,d) in formation in which x,y,z are the location of the landmark in 3D and d is the distance of the landmark to the unknown point to be localized. You should test your program to ensure it works with diﬀerent input points correctly. Your program will be tested on several diﬀerent setups and should provide reasonable output (i.e. for each coordinate of (x,y,z), either the absolute or relative error is less than 10−6). multilaterate.py takes a single argument: the dataﬁle name. Your program should then print out the location that is computed. A skeleton multilaterate.py is provided.
For your submission, besides the implementation, you need to provide a PDF ﬁle placed in the same folder to explain your implementation, i.e., how do you compute the location. This does not need to too mathematical, i.e., you can use mostly verbal descriptions to explain the main ideas behind your computation.
Problem 2 [50 points]. Implementation of a 2D Kalman ﬁlter. Suppose that there is a point mass moving in 2D with the system equation being xk =x1,k x2,k =x1,k−1 x2,k−1 +u1,k−1 u2,k−1 + ωk−1, and the observer being zk =z1,k z2,k =x1,k x2,k + νk. Assume that the system noise ω is a zero mean Gaussian with the covariance matrix Q =10−4 2×10−5 2×10−5 10−4 

and the measurement noise is a zero mean Gaussian with the covariance matrix R =10−2 5×10−3 5×10−3 2×10−2 .
For your solution, you should provide
1. The Kalman ﬁlter update equations for this system (in a .pdf ﬁle). Put this ﬁle under the same folder as the other ﬁles for this problem.
2. A python ﬁle named kalman2d.py that you need to implement to process the given data (a skeleton ﬁle is provided). The python program takes four additional arguments. The ﬁrst argument is the data ﬁle name. The second and third arguments are ˆ x1,0 and ˆ x2,0, respectively. The last argument is a value λ that will be used to compute P0 as P0 = λI in which I is the identity matrix. After getting the predicted (x1,k,x2,k) values, plot them using matplotlib as a set of 2D points and connect them sequentially using line segments. Do the same in the same plot to the observations (i.e., (z1,k,z2,k)) using a diﬀerent color.
A data ﬁle including the data below is also included in the problem folder. Your program should work for data that is diﬀerent from this provided data set.
